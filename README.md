Task Manager 0.1.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/littlewhywhat/TaskManager.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/littlewhywhat/TaskManager)
===
The basic todo list that everyone once used in their life, were several lines written on a piece of paper. It's simple and fast to create.

However once written the list is fixed and to keep it clean one should already know in prior how it will look like.

Task Manager 1.0.0 simplify a process of editing a todo list. In any time it's possible to add a new task, edit existing or delete task that became irrelevant or was finished. It's easy to change an order of tasks.
